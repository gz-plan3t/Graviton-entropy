Welcome to Hawking Filter Calculator!
********************************************************************************
TUTORIAL:
Execute directly the code or use the executable file. When the program starts running it will have only two following prompts:

"Enter the folder path where the input CSV file is located:"
"Enter the interpolation radius:"

The folder path is a string input like "C:\My_Folder\Documents\"
The interpolation radius corresponds to the unit of cell of interpolation which is measured in meters and generally considered to be 1/4 of the acquisition geophysical spacement.
Your input file must be renamed to 'grav_data.csv'.
The 'grav_data.csv' file must contain the headers: 'x', 'y', and 'bouguer', not in these literal names, but representing:
x = The first column containing the Easting coordinates;
y = The second column containing the Northing coordinates;
bouguer = The third column containing the bouguer anomaly values in 'milligals'.
OBS.: All the output files will be saved in the initially chosen folder path
      The used method of interpolation for the plots is 'cubic'
********************************************************************************
FILE STRUCTURES:
All the 'csv' files must have as delimiter = ','
The decimal separator of the values is '.'
The output 'csv' file is 'Entropy_data.csv'
File 'Entropy_data.csv' contains in its header the corresponding columns:
'x', 'y', 'boug', 'Entropy', 'Googolbyte'
'Entropy' is in Base 10 Log representation - unit: Planck Area
'Googolbyte' is expressed in googolbytes - unit: 1.6 x 10^100 bits
